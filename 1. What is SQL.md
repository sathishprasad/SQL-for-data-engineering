# What is SQL?

SQL, short for Structured Query Language, serves as a standardized language for managing relational databases. Much like how we employ different languages such as English or Hindi for communication, SQL serves as the means by which we interact with databases.

## Why is SQL Significant in Data Engineering?

Data engineering entails the process of collecting, transforming, and storing data in a manner that facilitates easy analysis and accessibility. SQL plays a pivotal role in this process, as it empowers data engineers to:

1. Retrieve data: SQL enables data engineers to extract specific data from a database by querying it based on particular criteria, ensuring data is easily accessible.
2. Manipulate data: SQL also allows data engineers to modify data within a database by adding, deleting, or updating records, ensuring data accuracy and currency.
3. Manage data: SQL empowers data engineers to administer databases by creating tables, establishing relationships between tables, and configuring security permissions, promoting data organization and security.

## Types of SQL Commands

In simple terms, SQL encompasses various keywords that we utilize to execute desired actions.


1. **DDL (Data Definition Language):**
DDL serves as a language for defining the structure of a database, which includes creating, altering, and dropping tables and other database components.

```sql
-- Use CREATE TABLE statement to generate a new table with columns and data types
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Use ALTER TABLE statement to add a new column to an existing table
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);

-- Use DROP TABLE statement to eliminate a table from the database
DROP TABLE customers;
```

2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
DML functions as a language for manipulating data stored in a database. It encompasses actions like adding, deleting, updating, and retrieving data from the database.

```sql
-- Use INSERT statement to add new data to a table
INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@email.com');

-- Use UPDATE statement to modify existing data in a table
UPDATE customers SET email = 'new@email.com' WHERE name = 'John Doe';

-- Use DELETE statement to remove data from a table
DELETE FROM customers WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

3. **DCL (Data Control Language):**
DCL serves as a language for controlling access to the database by creating and managing user accounts and permissions.

```sql
-- Use CREATE USER statement to create a new user account with specific permissions
CREATE USER 'new_user' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON customers TO new_user;
```

4. **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** 
TCL comprises a set of SQL commands employed to manage transactions in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

```sql
-- Use BEGIN TRANSACTION statement to initiate a new transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Use COMMIT statement to save changes made during a transaction
COMMIT;

-- Use ROLLBACK statement to revert changes made during a transaction
ROLLBACK;
```

## **SQL Keywords**

You can accomplish a substantial portion of tasks by mastering a limited subset of functions, even though SQL boasts more than hundreds of keywords. Focusing on 15-20 highly utilized keywords suffices.

1. **SELECT**: Retrieves data from one or more database tables.
2. **FROM**: Specifies the table or tables from which to retrieve data.
3. **WHERE**: Filters data based on specific criteria.
4. **JOIN**: Combines data from two or more tables.
5. **GROUP** **BY**: Groups data based on a specific column or set of columns.
6. **ORDER** **BY**: Sorts data based on a specific column or set of columns.
7. **HAVING**: Filters grouped data based on specific criteria.
8. **INSERT**: Inserts new data into a table.
9. **UPDATE**: Updates existing data in a table.
10. **DELETE**: Deletes data from a table.
11. **CREATE**: Creates a new database, table, view, or other database object.
12. **ALTER**: Modifies the structure of an existing database object.
13. **DROP**: Deletes an existing database object.
14. **Aggregation function** (MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT)
15. **JOINS (INNER, LEFT, FULL)**: Joins multiple tables
16. **CASE** **STATEMENT**: Implements conditional statements in SQL
17. **Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER)**: Utilized for numbering or ranking different rows
